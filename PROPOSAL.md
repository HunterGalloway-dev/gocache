- **Separation of Concerns**:
  - Explain how responsibilities are clearly divided across components, layers, or services.
  - Discuss how this separation improves code readability, reusability, and scalability.
  - Mention how this design adheres to principles like *Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)* or *Domain-Driven Design (DDD)*, if applicable.
- **Inter-Module Communication**:
  - Describe how modules or components communicate with each other (e.g., through APIs, messaging, or events).
  - Emphasize how this communication respects the boundaries of each module.

- Include diagrams or visuals, if necessary, to showcase the modular structure and interactions between components.

## 5. Testing the Solution
- **Testing Objectives**:
  - Define the purpose and scope of testing.
- **Test Scenarios**:
  - Scenario 1: [Description of the scenario and expected outcome]
  - Scenario 2: [Description of the scenario and expected outcome]
  - [Additional scenarios as necessary]
- **Testing Methods**:
  - Describe the tools, frameworks, or methodologies used for testing.
  - Explain how tests will measure the solutionâ€™s success.
- **Results**:
  - Specify how test results will be analyzed and used to validate the solution.

## 6. Comparison with the Older Solution
- **Overview of the Older Solution**:
  - Briefly describe the existing or previous approach.
- **Key Differences**:
  - Highlight differences in methodology, performance, or outcomes.
  - Use a comparison table, if helpful:

| Feature/Metric      | Older Solution        | Proposed Solution        |
|---------------------|-----------------------|--------------------------|
| Performance         | [Value/Description]  | [Value/Description]      |
| Cost                | [Value/Description]  | [Value/Description]      |
| Usability           | [Value/Description]  | [Value/Description]      |
| [Other Criteria]    | [Value/Description]  | [Value/Description]      |

- **Lessons Learned**:
  - Discuss limitations of the older solution and how the proposed solution addresses them.

## 7. Consequences
- **Positive Outcomes**:
  - Expected benefits or improvements if the proposal is implemented.
- **Risks and Mitigations**:
  - Identify potential risks or challenges.
  - Propose strategies to mitigate these risks.
- **Impact of Inaction**:
  - Describe the consequences of not addressing the problem.

## 8. Conclusion
- Summarize the problem, goal, and solution.
- Reinforce the importance of implementing the proposal.
- Provide a call to action, if appropriate.

## 9. Next Steps
- **Validation**:
  - Outline additional steps to confirm the validity and effectiveness of the solution after initial implementation.
  - For example:
    - Conduct long-term testing or pilot programs.
    - Gather real-world data and feedback.
    - Iterate on the solution based on new insights.
- **Stakeholder Engagement**:
  - Identify groups or individuals whose input or approval is critical for further refinement.
- **Scaling**:
  - Discuss steps to scale the solution, if applicable.
- **Monitoring and Evaluation**:
  - Establish key performance indicators (KPIs) and regular checkpoints for evaluation.
- **Exploration of Alternatives**:
  - Suggest areas where further research or alternative approaches may be necessary.
